# Carousel
React image carousel

I have used gulp to process some images from unsplash. It is fully responsive with breakpoints at 400w, 600w, 800w, 1000w, 1200w, 1920w.

I have used functional react components to make this and it is built using parcel. 

After you git clone the repo, just run `npm i && npm run dev` and the project is up and running at port:1234.
